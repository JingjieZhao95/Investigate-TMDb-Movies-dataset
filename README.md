# Investigate-TMDb-Movies-dataset

## Introduction
* The Movie Database (TMDb) is a community built movie and TV database. Since 2008, with more than 200K developers and companies using their platform, TMDb has become a premiere source of metadata. TMDB has about 549K movies on its database apparenty. 

* The dataset i will study below contains information about 1,000 movies collected from the movie database (TMDb), including user ratings and revenue. I will use vote average as the dependent vatiable of the first question and treat adjusted revenue as my dependent variable of the second question. By studying the impact of other factors in the database on vote averages and adjusted revenues, it help establish some more intuitive relationships that lead to higher vote averages and higher revenues.


## Variables
* Popularity
* Runtime
* Genres
* Vote_count
* Vote_average
* Release_year
* Budget_adj
* Revenue_adj (revenue in terms of 2010 dollars)

## Questions
1. What features are associated with higher vote averages?

2. What kinds of properties are associated with movies that have higher adjusted revenues?

## Conclusions
1. investgates what factors will make movies get higher vote averages. By studying the number of reviews, durations, budgets and other factors, we conclude that a high movie review usually requires high investment and has a wider consumer market. The length of the movie is not an important factor, which reflects that the audience will be more attracted to novel topics and high quality movies.

2. examines the factors related to the high profits of the film industry. By comparing variables such as market popularity, production year, film budget, film review, and duration of work, we can conclude that a successful profitable work is inseparable from the capital investment, and market response will also help profits rise linearly. In contrast, there is no intuitive relationship between market popularity and movie duration. Finally, it is worth mentioning that as more people are join to the film industry, the rapid development of the film industry has reduced the average profit of the work.

## Evaluation
The results also have some limitations. When I was processing the data, I droped some of the data due to the lack of database information. If we can supplement the complete database, the final results could be more accurate. In addition, the classification of movies in this data is unclear, which makes it difficult to establish a relationship according to the type of movie in the final report. The type of movie could be an important sign that affects the audience market.
