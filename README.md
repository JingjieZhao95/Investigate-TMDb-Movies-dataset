# Investigate-TMDb-Movies-dataset

## Introduction
* The Movie Database (TMDb) is a community built movie and TV database. Since 2008, with more than 200K developers and companies using their platform, TMDb has become a premiere source of metadata. TMDB has about 549K movies on its database apparenty. 
* The dataset i will study below contains information about 1,000 movies collected from the movie database (TMDb), including user ratings and revenue. I will use vote average as the dependent vatiable of the first question and treat adjusted revenue as my dependent variable of the second question. By studying the impact of other factors in the database on vote averages and adjusted revenues, it help establish some more intuitive relationships that lead to higher vote averages and higher revenues.
